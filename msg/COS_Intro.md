# MATH introduce numbers (in unary notation)

Here we count up from zero, go through some primes, that sort of
thing.  Just like in the movies!  There is some syntax around the
numbers, and a structure to the "lesson," but it will be fine for the
listener to ignore all that for now.  Hopefully what they will pick up
on is:

 * There are some repeating patterns.
 * Between those patterns, there's a specific short unit repeating
   a varying number of times (we count in unary).
 * The number of times it varies smells like math.

We'll get to a more compact representation of numbers later, once
we've established the basics.
