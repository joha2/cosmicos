# PHYSICS introduce the elements

Introducing the elements is done well in the [DearET message](https://web.archive.org/web/20161017192136/http://www.dearet.org/testing-a-message) by [Michael Busch](https://seti.org/our-scientists/michael-busch).  We draw inspiration from that work.

The general idea here is that there are some physical ratios that should be known by
anybody with a handle on what is going on at the atomic level, and may be recognizable.
The pattern of how elementary particles are combined into atoms, and atoms into
molecules, may also ring a bell.
