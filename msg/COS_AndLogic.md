# MATH introduce the AND logical operator

We continue introducing symbols related to math and logic.  Now we will often
be able to both define them and give examples, so the listener has multiple
paths to understanding.

Here is `and`, which evaluates to `true` if both its two arguments are `true`,
and `false` otherwise.  We don't talk about wbat happens if you pass it integers
or something funky.  There'd be value in getting into talking about types, but
it might be a bit much just now.
