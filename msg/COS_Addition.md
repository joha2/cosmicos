# MATH introduce addition

Let's introduce some arithmetic, to show off still more sentence structure.
We show sentences of the mathematical form `X = Y + Z`, which in our message look like
`= X | + Y Z`.  From this, and the negation lesson, the listener will hopefully
start picking up on how to chain operations.

If the listener didn't already have a pretty clear idea of what `=` is,
then these sentences could just as easily be interpreted as being about subtraction.
Even having an idea of `=`, syntax is still fuzzy enough that this lesson may not
be unambiguous by itself.
