# MATH introduce equality and inequality of numbers

We've hopefully cued our listeners to be looking for mathematical
patterns.  So let's give them some more.  It doesn't matter so much
what patterns we give, as long as they are clear, and that there are
several of them.  Eventually we'll want the listener to start turning
things around, and use the parts of the message they understand (the
mathematical patterns) to learn something about the parts they don't
(the message structure and syntax).

Let's take a shot at introducing ways of comparing numbers.
No doubt we're revealing a feudal, reductive mindset in which
all things must be ranked in a hierachy.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

Equality is introduced by a series of true statements of the form `X = X` 
(the syntax is a little different than regular math, more like 
`= X X`, but that isn't important yet).  The listener will hopefully
discern a number getting repeated twice within the "sentence"
structure they've been seeing, but won't be sure yet what we are
driving at until we introduce non-equality and contrast with it.
