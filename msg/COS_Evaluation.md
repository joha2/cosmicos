# MATH show alternative groupings

We've advanced enough that we're starting to have choices about how
something is expressed.  Let's pause to acknowledge that, and
reinforce some syntactic equivalences so the listener can be confident
of them.

Parentheses play a role in grouping expressions, just like in regular
math.  To reduce the mental burden of tracking nesting, we use a `|` shortcut
that means "add parentheses between this point and as far as you can go."  So for
example `(= 7 | + 3 4)` is equivalent to `(= 7 (+ 3 4))`.
