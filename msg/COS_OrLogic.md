# MATH introduce the OR logical operator

Here is `or`, which evaluates to `true` if either of its arguments are `true`,
and `false` otherwise.  Again, we just don't talk about what happens if you
pass in any unexpected values, like integers or functions.  The message is
constructed so that the problem never comes up.
